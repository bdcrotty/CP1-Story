Dogs are pretty cool. 
I think that airplanes are pretty cool as well. 
I woke up and it was a good temperature. I took a shower.
I went to school, because that is what society and the governmeant force us to do. 
I felt really tired. 
I bought a coke from jewl. 
I also bought a sandwich. 
I ate on the soccer field and it was really hot. 
I went inside. 
I am now in 7th period.
